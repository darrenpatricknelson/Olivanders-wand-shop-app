        essential wizarding item: their wand. You can witness a unique
        interactive experience and see a wand choose a wizard. Visitors
        (including the wizard chosen* in the interactive experience) can
        purchase their own unique wand, wand sets, character wand replicas, or
        Interactive Wand.
